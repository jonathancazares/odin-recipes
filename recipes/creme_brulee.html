            <p>Five simple ingredients -<em>cream, vanilla, salt, eggs and sugar</em>- make for an exquisitely rich and elegant dessert.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups heavy or light cream, or half-and-half</li>
                <li>1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>5 egg yolks</li>
                <li>½ cup sugar, more for topping</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean and salt and cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes, then discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now.)</li><br>
                <li>In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a quarter of the cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg mixture into cream and stir. Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place ramekins in a baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool completely. <strong>Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days.</strong></li><br>
                <li>When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a thin layer. Place ramekins in a broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat source. Turn on broiler. Cook until sugar melts and browns or <em>even</em> blackens a bit, about 5 minutes. Serve within two hours.</li><br>
